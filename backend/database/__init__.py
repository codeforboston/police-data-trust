# TODO: remove star imports; at the moment it is a convenience to make sure
#  that all db models are loaded into the SQLAlchemy metadata.

# NOTE: We are deliberately _not_ loading all the models. The reason why is
#  because we want to do baby steps-- one model at a time. This ensures that
#  Alembic only does a couple models, not all of them.
